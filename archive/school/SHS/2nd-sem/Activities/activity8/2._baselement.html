    <p>Since we have specified a base URL, the browser will look for the image "logo.png" at "https://sycinue-rdc.github.io/archive/school/SHS/2nd-sem/Activities/activity8/assets/img/logo.png"</p>

    <p><a href="https://sycinue-rdc.github.io/index.html">Sycinue-rdc</a></p>
    <p>The link above opens in a new window. This is because the base target is set to "_blank".</p>
